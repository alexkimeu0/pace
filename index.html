                <h2>Sound</h2>
                <p>The bass on the Pace Live headphones is neutral – not too heavy. But the sound is loud enough even to
                    that extent where you wouldn’t put up with anymore. So if you like your headphone’s bass neutral and
                    loud enough, you can consider this a cheap alternative to have.</p>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p> The design is nice for this price point. You don’t expect much, but from what I’ve seen, the design
                    is
                    fine.. just okay. They are made from plastic with a rubberized band on top to give your head a soft
                    touch while having them on.</p>

                <h2>Battery Life</h2>
                <p>Pace Africa promises up to 15 hours of battery life on a single charge. But in my experience, that
                    has
                    not been the case. In my tests, the battery dipped by 30% by listening to audio for around three
                    hours.
                    In total, I received around 8hours of battery life (7 hours 54minutes, to be exact). </p>
